## üîπ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
cd ~/Dev/
git clone https://github.com/rjwiechecki/kdp-automation.git
cd kdp-automation
```

### 2. Create `.env` file

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
touch .env
```

Add the following environment variables:

```bash
GMAIL_SENDER=your.email@gmail.com
GMAIL_RECEIVER=recipient.email@gmail.com
GMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-specific-password
```

### 3. Set up Firefox Profile

- Create a **dedicated Firefox profile** called `FirefoxUserDataClean` under `browser_profiles/`
- Import bookmarks, cookies, and extensions manually
- Log into Amazon & KDP and disable OTP on trusted browser if possible

To manually launch and configure it:

```bash
/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox --no-remote -profile /path/to/browser_profiles/FirefoxUserDataClean
```

### 4. Manual Cookie Capture (Optional First Run)

If cookies aren't captured automatically:

```bash
python3 cookie_imports.py
```

Follow prompts to login manually and capture cookies.

### 5. Test the Scraper

```bash
python3 kdp_report_scraper.py
```

### 6. Test the Email Sender

```bash
python3 send_email_report.py
```

### 7. Set up Cron Jobs (Automation)

Edit your `crontab`:

```bash
crontab -e
```
